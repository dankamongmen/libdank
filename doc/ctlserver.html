  <h2>Interface and Implementation of ctlserver</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>
   	<h4>Overview</h4>
	Any program calling app_init() with an app_ctx structure having a
	non-NULL value for its ctlsrvsocket field will launch a ctlserver
	thread, which will be automatically cleaned up in app_stop(). Failures
	while setting up the ctlserver will be noted in app_init()'s return
	value, but will not halt app_init(). If the ctlserver is to be used,
	all source files to be linked must be compiled with threading support.
   	<br><br>
	The calling process will attempt to bind and listen on the named pipe
	specified by ctlsrvsocket, relative to the application's chroot. A
	failure will not lead to retry; no ctlserver will be available
	(<b>FIXME</b> -- see note in init_ctlserver()). If these operations
	succeed, the ctlserver thread will be spawned with this socket as its
	argument.
   	<br><br>
	Each connection will see a ctldrone thread spawned to handle the
	resulting socket descriptor. There is currently no internal limit on
	ctldrone spawning (<b>FIXME</b>).
   	<br><br>
   </li>
   <li>
   	<h4>Role</h4>
	ctlserver is a pluggable component in the app framework, and a
	transport protocol extending SCM_RIGHTS-capable sockets to allow full
	stdio muxing.
	<br><br>
	It provides *no application layer services*. Most importantly, the
	ctlserver protocol has no concept of a command's "success" or
	"failure". This is done purposefully -- otherwise we'd want to rollback
	changes whose successful application wasn't confirmed with the UI, and
	down that path lies madness.
	<br><br>
	ctlserver operates over SOCK_STREAM (connection-oriented) sockets only.
	The SOCK_SEQPACKET type is an interesting one to consider, but it is
	currently not acceptably portable.
	<br><br>
   </li>
   <li>
   	<h4>Protocol</h4>
	Upon connecting to the ctlserver, the client must send a file
	descriptor using the SCM_RIGHTS ancillary message type. Data read from
	the server over the primary connection should be mapped to stdout; data
	read from the passed file descriptor should be mapped to stderr. This
	is done most simply by passing the result of fileno(stderr), after
	having verified it as non-negative.
	<br><br>
	SCM_RIGHTS transfers over SOCK_STREAM PF_UNIX sockets require at least
	one ancillary byte of data. Four octets shall be sent, these being the
	protocol version in network byte order. Protocol version disagreements
	should result in both parties' immediate termination of the connection,
	and generation of a diagnostic.
	<br><br>
	Any failure at the transport level should result in immediate
	termination of the connection by both parties; the stderr channel is
	for application-layer error data only. Shutdown requests directed to
	the client or server should result in termination of all connections
	and no further transmissions.
	<br><br>
	After passing the file descriptor, the client shall send a command and
	its associated data. The command is the first message to arrive --
	remember, UNIX sockets preserve message boundaries. This is followed by
	the data, in any number of messages. Data length is bounded by
	available memory only. Follow the data with an EOF. Any 8-bit data may
	be transmitted.
	<br><br>
	The server might reply with 8-bit data on either or both of the
	descriptors. Output on either file descriptor is unterminated; read
	until EOF.
